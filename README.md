🧪 Khagrachari Daily Testing Project

This repository contains my daily manual and automation testing practices based on real-time project scenarios from Khagrachari modules.

🔍 What’s Inside

Manual Testing: Functional, regression, and exploratory test cases

API Testing: Performed with Postman (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods)

Automation Scripts: Selenium with Python (you can change to Java if needed)

Bug Tracking: Recorded and reported using standard QA formats

Daily Logs: Documenting test execution and results

🎯 Objective

To improve hands-on QA skills through consistent testing practice and to simulate real-world QA workflows from requirement analysis to defect reporting.
